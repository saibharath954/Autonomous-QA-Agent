UI/UX Guidelines

1. Form Validation:
   - All required fields must trigger an HTML5 validation warning if empty.
   - Email validation errors must be displayed in red text (#FF0000).
   - Error messages should appear inline next to the field.

2. Buttons:
   - The 'Pay Now' button should be green (#008000) to indicate a primary action.
   - 'Apply' discount button should be standard gray.

3. Success States:
   - Upon successful payment, hide the form and display "Payment Successful!" in green text.
